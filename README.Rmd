The following code allows to reach an RMSE of respectively **1766973.99205** and 1592864.42967 on private and public leaderboard (**20th rank**).

***

Packages used : *caret*, *dplyr*. 

***

A random forest with *mtry=2* (number of variables randomly selected at each split) and *n.tree=5000* (number of trees) is performed.   
Considering the small number of observations in *train*, the out-of-sample error and the parameter *mtry* have been estimated using a 10-fold cross-validation repeated 5 times.

***

The *train* and *test* datasets are available in my github repository and [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/restaurant-revenue-prediction/data). 

***

Once the two datasets are in the **working directory**, the code can be run.
